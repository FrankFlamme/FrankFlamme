### Hi there, I'm Frank ðŸ‘‹:computer:
I've been working in IT and software development for 25 years. Starting with Basic and Turbo Pascal, I have learned many programming languages over the years, such as C, C++, C# or Java. Within my projects I somehow got stuck with C# and Microsoft technologies in 2001. However, I am not fixed on this and I also deal with more modern languages like GO or Rust. Since a few years I also deal with the topic game development where I use mostly C# and the game engine Unity.
